You are given a string S consisting of N lowercase English letters. In how many ways can we split S into two non-empty parts, such that in at least one part the letter 'x' and the letter 'y' occur the same number of times?
Write a function:
function solution(S);
that, given a string S of length N, returns the number of splits S satisfying the condition above.
Examples:
1. Given S = "ayxbx", the function should return 3. There are four possible splits of S: "a/yxbx", "ay/xbx", "ayx/bx" and "ayxb/x". Only "ay/xbx" does not fulfill the condition, so the answer is 3. Note that in "a/yxbx" the left part has 0 occurrences of 'x' and 'y', so it counts as correct split.
2. Given S = "xzzzy", the function should return 0.
3. Given S = "toyxmy", the function should return 5.
4. Given S = "apple", the function should return 4.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [2..200,000];
string S is made only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z).
